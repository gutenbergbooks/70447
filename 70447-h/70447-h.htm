  <hr>

  <p>The concensus of modern scientific opinion favors the belief that the
    so-called American-Indian race represents the autochthonous people or
    aborigines of the great American Continent. Referring to the origin
    of the American Indians, Professor Pritchard says: “The era of their
    existence as a distinct and insulated race must probably be dated as
    far back as that time which separated into nations the inhabitants
    of the Old World, and gave to each branch of the human family its
    primitive language and individuality.” The origin of the Amerinds of
    America has still to be sought amid the sources of the various races of
    mankind from primeval times.</p>

  <p>The Indian tribes of New England belonged to the great Algonquian
    Confederacy—the most widely extended of all the North American
    Indians—their territory stretching along the Atlantic coast from
    Labrador to Pamlico sound, and westward, from Newfoundland to the Rocky
    Mountains.</p>

  <p>The three principal Massachusetts tribes were the Massachusetts or
    Naticks, the Nipmucks, and the Wampanoags, the latter under the
    dominance of Massasoit when the Pilgrims arrived, and, at that time,
    the third greatest nation in New England.</p>

  <p>With regard to the primeval discovery of the island of Nantucket by the
    Indians the following legend is interesting, (as all legends are), and
    it was related by the aborigines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> to the early English settlers, soon
    after their arrival.</p>

  <p>In former times, a good many moons ago, a bird, extraordinary for its
    size, used often to visit the south shore of Cape Cod, and carry from
    thence in its talons a vast number of small children. Maushope, who
    was an Indian giant, as fame reports, resided in these parts. Enraged
    at the havoc among the children, he, on a certain time, waded into the
    sea in pursuit of the bird, till he had crossed the sound, and reached
    Nantucket. Before Maushope forded the sound, the island was unknown to
    the red men. Maushope found the bones of the children in a heap under a
    large tree. He, then, wishing to smoke his pipe, ransacked the island
    for tobacco; but finding none, he filled his pipe with poke—a weed
    which the Indians sometimes used as a substitute.</p>

  <p>“Ever since this memorable event, fogs have been frequent on the Cape.
    In allusion to this tradition, when the aborigines observed a fog
    rising, they would say, ‘There comes old Maushope’s smoke.’”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (Here
    the legend unfortunately ends.)</p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Col. Mass. Hist. Soc. Vol. V. First Series, page 57.</div>

  <p>The island of Nantucket, when first settled by the whites, was occupied
    by two tribes whose names have not been preserved. One occupied the
    west end of the island, and was supposed to have come from the mainland
    by way of Martha’s Vineyard. The other lived at the east end, and
    is said to have come direct from the mainland. The two tribes were
    independent and were, at a time, hostile to each other. The tribe which
    came from Martha’s Vineyard was subject to the Wampanoags.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <hr class="fn">

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

  <p>When the original discovery of the island of Nantucket was made by
    foreigners is still a moot point, many writers alleging that two hardy
    Norsemen, Bjorne Herjulfson, in A. D. 986, and Leif Ericsson, in A.
    D. 1000, during their respective voyages, had both sighted the New
    England coast, and that Leif had visited Nantucket, and bestowed upon
    it the name of Nauticon. If this is probable, it is equally probable
    that the name Nauticon was merely a Norse approximation to the original
    Indian name of the island, viz: <b>Natocket</b><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. It is now generally
    believed, however, that neither of these navigators got nearer to the
    New England coast than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, although there is
    much to be said on both sides of the question.</p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> H. B. Worth: Nantucket Hist. Asso., Vol. 11, Bull. 6, p.
    290.</div>

  <p>With regard to “Vinland”, which Leif Ericsson is said to have visited
    on his way to Greenland, a circumstantial account of his voyaging
    is given in the Norse saga—the <b>Flateyarbok and the Hauksbok</b>.
    These accounts were subsequently confirmed by Adam of Bremen, in
    his <b>History of the Bremen Church, etc.</b>, and in the MSS. of
    numerous historians, from the eleventh to the fifteenth century; but
    the conjecture is not adequately substantiated by facts to warrant a
    conclusion, and it seems impossible in this age to divest the ancient
    story from the cloud of myth and mystery which surrounds it.</p>

  <p>It seems strange, nevertheless, that the name Nautican is that applied
    to Nantucket island by Sir Ferdinand Gorges (<b>circa</b> 1630), and
    Nantican in Hough’s book, under the date 1641.</p>

  <p>John Cabot, the navigator—of Italian birth—settled in Bristol,
    England, in the time of Henry VII., and he obtained a patent from the
    King “for the purpose of discovering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> unknown lands in the eastern,
    western and northern seas.” His son Sebastian accompanied him, and in
    1497–1498, they cruised along the coast of America from Florida to
    Labrador. <b>The claim of the English Government to Nantucket, Martha’s
    Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands was based upon these voyages of the
    Cabots.</b></p>

  <p>Nantucket, however, looms out of mythland and into genuine history,
    when, in June or July, 1602, Bartholomew Gosnold, an English mariner,
    landed upon its shore at Sankaty Head, when he, and some thirty
    sailors, were <b>en route</b> for Virginia, seeking a new plantation.</p>

  <p>In May, 1605, Captain Weymouth is said to have “become entangled among
    the Nantucket Shoals”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and in 1620 Captain Dermer certainly visited
    the island.</p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Drake’s <b>Nooks and Corners of New England</b>, p. 324.</div>

  <p>In approaching the consideration of the <b>Nantucket</b> Indians, the
    following beautiful legend<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> cannot be passed over in silence, as it
    reveals the fact that self-sacrifice and the tender passion are not
    limited in their influence to any race or color, but are the hallowed
    heritage of mankind. Such a record deserves a foremost place in any
    associated local history. The incident referred to is supposed to have
    occurred about 1630, or, as Dr. Ewer suggested, about thirty years
    before the arrival of the white men.</p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> A worthy poetic setting of this legend was published by
    “The Inquirer and Mirror” nearly forty years ago, from the pen of Miss
    Charlotte P. Baxter. It was republished in the “Inquirer” of January
    21st, 1911, and the poetic quotations in this preface have been taken
    from it.</div>

  <p>Wauwinet was the sage and beloved Sachem of the Northeastern section of
    the Island. He had one daughter, Wonoma,—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“The loveliest and the gentlest,”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>
  <p>and they were devoted to each other.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Well she knew the art of healing;</div>
        <div class="i0">Skilled was she in all the uses</div>
        <div class="i0">Of the herbs that grew around them.</div>
        <div class="i0">And whenever from the waters</div>
        <div class="i0">Spoke the voice of the Great Spirit,</div>
        <div class="i0">She could tell unto her people</div>
        <div class="i0">What the words were, and the meaning.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fever had broken out among the natives of the south-western section of
    the island, which was under the dominance of the Chief Autopscot, and
    he feared that his people would be swept away by the rapid spread of
    the pestilence. In his extremity he thought of the fair and graceful
    Wonoma, Wauwinet’s daughter, and knowing she possessed the knowledge of
    a great medicine-man, he despatched one of his maidens, named Wosoka,
    to speed to Wonoma,—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Praying her to come and save them,</div>
        <div class="i2">From the cruel, blasting Fever.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Wonoma, always delighting to do good, accompanied the little maid back
    to her stricken people, and, in a little time, the plague was stayed,
    and she healed and comforted those who would have died but for her
    skilful and kindly help. By her skill, her winsomeness and her sympathy
    she won the hearts of all the natives, and, when the time of her
    departure came, they begged her to remain with them, so that they might
    show their gratitude.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“For the boon of Life She gave them.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Then the brave Autopscot pleaded, not only for his people, but for
    himself, that she should not go from them, and he ended by eloquently
    and fervently declaring his love for her; and Wonoma, deeply touched,
    smilingly replied:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“That because She loved his people</div>
        <div class="i0">But more truly loved their leader,</div>
        <div class="i0">She would come again among them,—</div>
        <div class="i0">Come again to go not from them.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Later, the friendly and fraternal feeling which had long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> existed
    between the tribes of Wauwinet and Autopscot gradually changed to
    feelings of anger and hatred in consequence of some petty differences
    as to the dividing line between their respective territories. A feud
    was generated and bloodshed was threatened between the contending
    parties. Wauwinet and his braves, in solemn council, had agreed upon a
    subtle plan for overcoming their enemies; but Wonoma had overheard the
    deliberations of the war-council, and resolved to save her lover at
    all hazards. When her people were asleep she stole out of her wigwam,
    and, securing a canoe, rowed through the darkness, with a prayer in
    her heart to the Father of all mercies that she might be enabled to
    save him who was now dearer to her than even her own people. Over sea
    and land she hurried on, her feet bleeding and weary, and when she
    arrived at her destination, she was completely exhausted. When she had
    found him whom her heart desired, she told him what she had heard, and
    leaving her in charge of some of the maidens to rest, Autopscot called
    his people together, and bade them to be prepared to receive the enemy
    on the morrow.</p>

  <p>When, next day, Wauwinet and his braves proceeded to attack the enemy
    unawares, and found them armed and ready to receive them, instead of
    unprepared as he had expected, he simply turned around, and, with his
    warriors retraced his footsteps to his own possessions.</p>

  <p>On the following evening, as Wauwinet stood in deep thought at the
    door of his wigwam, an oncoming footstep aroused him, and, bending
    courteously, Autopscot stood before him, and thus addressed the father
    of his love:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Oh, my father! Oh, most noble!</div>
        <div class="i0">Dark have been the days about us,</div>
        <div class="i0">And still darker have the nights been;—</div>
        <div class="i0">In our hearts the darkest hatred;</div>
        <div class="i0">Hear me speak, Oh mighty father!</div>
        <div class="i0">For the love I bear Wonoma,—</div>
        <div class="i0">For the sake of both our people,</div>
        <div class="i0">May there not be peace between us?</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>
  <p>Wauwinet’s brow was clouded with anger as Autopscot spoke, but
    gradually the frown relaxed, and when the brave young chief had
    finished, the elder was silent for a time, and thus replied in tones of
    friendly feeling:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">********“(Oh, my son, Autopscot,</div>
        <div class="i8">Great has been the lesson taught me,</div>
        <div class="i8">That I, myself, am not almighty,—</div>
        <div class="i8">That there is a power beyond me,</div>
        <div class="i8">Unto which I have to yield me.</div>
        <div class="i8">Great the love I bear Wonoma,</div>
        <div class="i8">And if she so truly loves you,</div>
        <div class="i8">There should only be between us</div>
        <div class="i8">Words and thoughts that are most friendly.”</div>
      </div>

  <p>When Wauwinet had thus spoken, the two chiefs grasped each other by
    the hand in mutual affection, and, before they parted, they amicably
    arranged between them the land which had caused their dispute, and
    while pledging themselves to enduring peace, Wauwinet gladly sanctioned
    the union of Wonoma and Autopscot. From that day to this Peace has
    reigned over and blest the island of Nantucket.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The story of the transfer of the Island of Nantucket from the English
    Government to Thomas Mayhew, and from him and the Indians to the white
    settlers, has so often been told that a mere summary is all that is
    required here, in order to preserve the continuity of the narrative.</p>

  <p>Nantucket was included in the Royal grant to Plymouth Company in 1621,
    and Lord Stirling and Sir Ferdinand Gorges were the Commissioners
    deputed to promote the colonization of the territory, including the
    islands south of Cape Cod.</p>

  <p>Lord Stirling appointed James Forrett as his agent in New York for
    the sale or other disposal of the Colony, and Forrett sold the island
    of Nantucket, in 1641, (when it was under the jurisdiction of the
    Province of New York), to Thomas Mayhew, an Englishman, who emigrated
    to New England in 1631, and who first settled at Watertown. Mayhew not
    only purchased Nantucket, and the adjacent islands, but became a part
    proprietor of Martha’s Vineyard and Governor of that island. He is said
    to have been a good colonizer—always a friend to the Indians—and was
    the means of preventing them from engaging in Philip’s war. He founded
    Edgartown in 1647, and from him were descended numerous missionaries to
    the Indians, amongst whom they had much influence, and spoke the Indian
    language fluently.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

  <p>The islands remained in the possession of the Mayhews (father and son),
    until 1659, when they were transferred to ten purchasers, including
    Mayhew himself, (as he reserved to himself and his heirs one-twentieth
    part of the property for his own use.)</p>

  <p>From a reliable genealogy of the Coffin family<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> it appears that in
    the spring of 1659 “Tristram Coffin proceeded upon a voyage of inquiry
    and observation—first to Martha’s Vineyard where he secured Peter
    Folger, the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin, as an interpreter of the
    Indian language; and thence to Nantucket, his object being to ascertain
    the temper and disposition of the Indians, and the capabilities of
    the island, so that he might report to the citizens of Salisbury what
    inducements for emigration thither were offered.”</p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> <b>Vide</b> Godfrey’s <b>Island of Nantucket</b>, p. 169.</div>

  <p>He was evidently impressed favorably by what he saw and heard, for,
    when he returned to Salisbury, Mass., a company was formed, and the
    purchase of the island determined. In the autumn of 1659 Thomas Macy,
    Edward Starbuck, James Coffin, Isaac Coleman and some of their wives
    and children sailed in an open boat for Nantucket, where they arrived
    safely, and spent the winter of 1659–60 on the island.</p>

  <p>In July, 1660, Starbuck returned to Salisbury and Amesbury, and induced
    a number of families to accompany him back to Nantucket, and as time
    went on the little colony received numerous additions.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Most, if not all, of the English settlers came from
    Salisbury, Mass., and its neighborhood.</div>

  <p>Each of the original colonists was permitted to name an associate,
    so that the island was primarily divided into twenty shares, and as
    these were anxious to add to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> number, and to induce artisans
    and mechanics to come among them, the number of shares was ultimately
    increased to twenty-seven, these including the entire island, with the
    exception of the “common” land, and that reserved by Mr. Mayhew for his
    own use.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>During the next hundred years—say from 1664 to 1774—the records contain
    the many transfers of lots of land deeded by the Indians to the
    English, until, indeed, the entire island became the property of the
    white settlers.</p>

  <p>Before the legal purchase of the island could be ratified, it was
    necessary to secure the sanction of the representative Indian chiefs
    and this was duly obtained as appears from the following deed, dated
    May 10th, 1660:—</p>

  <div class="center mt3"><b>SACHEMS’ DEED OF NANTUCKET.</b></div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>These presents witness, May the tenth, sixteen hundred and sixty,
      that we, Wanackmamack and Nickanoose, head Sachems of Nantucket
      island, do give, grant, bargain, and sell unto Mr. Thomas Mayhew
      of Marthas Vineyard, Tristram Coffin, Senior, Thomas Macy,
      Christopher Hussey, Richard Swain, Peter Coffin, Stephen Greenleaf,
      Thomas Barnard, John Swain and William Pile, all the Land,
      Meadow, Marshes, Timber and Wood, and all appurtenances thereunto
      belonging, and being and lying from the west end of the island of
      Nantucket, unto the Pond, called by the Indians, Waqutuquab, and
      from the head of that Pond, upon a straight line, unto the Pond
      situated by Monomoy Harbor or Creek, now called Wheeler’s Creek,
      and so from the northeast corner of the said Pond to the sea, that
      is to say, all the right that we, the aforesaid Sachems have in the
      said tract of land, provided that none of the Indian Inhabitants,
      in or about the woodland, or whatsoever Indians, within the last
      purchase of land, from the head of the Pond to Monomoy Harbor,
      shall be removed without full satisfaction. And we, the aforesaid
      Sachems, do give, grant, bargain and sell, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>one-half of the
      remainder of the meadows and marshes upon all other parts of the
      Island. And also that the English people shall have what grass
      they shall need for to mow, out of the remainder of the meadows
      and marshes on the Island, so long as the English remain upon the
      Island, and also free liberty for timber and wood upon any part of
      the Island within the jurisdiction. And also, we, the aforesaid
      Sachems, do full grant free liberty to the English for the feeding
      all sorts of cattle on any part of the Island, after Indian Harvest
      is ended until planting time, or until the first day of May, from
      year to year forever, for and in consideration of twelve pounds
      already paid, and fourteen pounds to be paid within three months
      after the date hereof.</p>

    <p>To have and to hold the aforesaid purchase of land, and other
      appurtenances, as aforementioned, to them, Mr. Thomas Macy,
      Tristram Coffin, Thomas Mayhew, and the rest aforementioned, and

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

  <p>It is rather curious that this deed, although duly witnessed on May
    10th, 1660, was not confirmed by Peter Folger until January first,
    1664, and did not receive official attestation by the Secretary of the
    General Court until the 12th of June, 1677.</p>

  <p>This deed purchased the island from the original patentee and a greater
    part of it from the Indians, and the English are said to have paid £26
    for it. Almost a year before the execution of the above deed, however,
    what is known as “The First Indian Deed” was executed by Nickanoose and
    Nanahuma on June 20th, 1659. It is as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“This doth witness that we Nickanoose of Nantucket, Sachem, and
      Nanahuma of Nantucket, Sachem, have sold unto Thomas Mayhew of the
      Vineyard the plain at the west end of Nantucket that is according
      to the figure under written, to him and his heirs and assigns
      forever. In consideration whereof we have received by earnest of
      the said Thomas Mayhew the sum of twelve pounds. Also the said
      Sachems have sold the said Mayhew of the Vineyard the use of the
      meadow and to take wood for the use of him, the said Mayhew, his
      heirs and assigns forever.”</p>

      hands this 20th of June, 1659.”</p>

      it.”</p>

      <span class="ml15">Tristram Coffin.</span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I shall refer more particularly to this deed presently.</p>

  <p>As an example of further deeds the following may be quoted.</p>

  <p>January 5th, 1660, Nickanoose out of free voluntary love for Edward
    Starbuck gave him “Coretue”, which was reassigned by Edward Starbuck,
    August 30th, 1668.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

  <p>May 10th, 1660, Wanackmamack and Nicornoose, Head Sachems of Nantucket,
    sold unto the first purchasers between west end of island and pond
    called by the Indians Waqutuquat (Waquittaquah)—then on a straight
    line to pond by Monomoy harbour; also half of remainder of meadows and
    marshes on all other parts of the island.</p>

  <p>Witnessed by Peter Folger, Edward Starbuck and Felix Kuttashamaquat.</p>

  <p>June 22d, 1662, Wanackmamack signed a deed conveying a neck of land
    in the eastern section of the island known as Pocomo Neck. This was
    witnessed by the younger Wauwinet, son of Nickanoose and by Peter
    Folger. The purchase was made by Tristram Coffin and Thomas Macy.</p>

  <p>February 20th, 1661, Wanackmamack, Head Sachem, sold the west half of
    Nantucket.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> See note 13 page 22.</div>

  <p>November 18th, 1671, shows that Tristram Coffin bought of Wanackmamack
    and Nicornoose from Monomoy to Waquittaquage pond, Nanahumack Neck, and
    all from Wesco to the West end of Nantucket.</p>

  <p>June 20th, 1682, Deed of Nicornoose, Sachem, to James Coffin, William
    Worth and John Swain—the grass and herbage of all his lands from Indian
    harvest to first of May.</p>

  <p>And thus the land sales go on, until 1774, when the sachems and Indians
    had virtually sold every spot in their possession to the English.</p>

  <p>As Mr. H. B. Worth aptly points out, “Nickanoose signed deeds only
    of territory belonging to some other sachem; the fact is true of
    Wanackmamack. Neither signed a deed of any portion of the territory
    under his direct control. The Sachem Attapehat (Autopscot), as far as
    has been found never signed any deed.”</p>

  <p>I can only account for these facts, by assuming that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> these Chief
    Sachems thought it beneath their dignity to sign deeds conveying their
    own property, while, at the same time they permitted no deeds to be
    signed without their approval and attestation. This may appear a lame
    suggestion, but it is the best I can offer.</p>

  <p>The Provincial Governor of New York in 1671, (Lord Lovelace), thought
    it desirable to obtain a new deed from the Sachems, attesting the
    legality of the land sales, and an assurance that the stipulated terms
    had been duly complied with, before issuing a new patent. The necessary
    proofs were furnished in that year by Wanackmamack the Chief Sachem.</p>

  <p>It may be stated here that Mr. Thomas Mayhew,—the original purchaser
    of the island, had acquired a good knowledge of the Indian language in
    association with the Indians of the more western island; and that Peter
    Folger who also resided at Martha’s Vineyard, was, in 1663, engaged
    by Tristram Coffin as interpreter, and to officiate in Nantucket, as
    miller, weaver and surveyor.</p>

  <p>What has been written thus far will, it is hoped, serve to illustrate
    the conditions under which the white settlers became established on
    Nantucket, and I now propose to deal briefly with the Indians whom they
    found there on their arrival. It may be noted that the names of many of
    the original white settlers are perpetuated in teeming numbers among
    the inhabitants of Nantucket until the present day.</p>

  <p>With regard to the number of Indians occupying the island when the
    whites arrived the statements vary considerably, some writers alleging
    3000, others 1500, and some still less. There is some difficulty in
    forming a correct estimate, but it is known as a fact that they only
    numbered about 360 before they became victims to the epidemic which
    destroyed so many of them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

  <p>When Nantucket was purchased by the colonists in 1659, there were
    two Chief Sachems Wanackmamack and Nicornoose (acting probably for
    Wauwinet), and at least two other Sachems, Autopscot (or Attapehat)
    and Potconet—besides a few petty Sachems—governing all the Indians on
    Nantucket and Tuckernuck. It may be assumed that at this time Wauwinet
    was old and feeble, and that his eldest son, known as Nicornoose, acted
    as his deputy, inasmuch as among several of the earliest deeds we
    find Nicornoose signing as Sachem, and there are no signatures by his
    father. Mr. Zaccheus Macy, in his valuable letter to the Massachusetts
    Historical Society, dated October 2d, 1792<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> mentions Wauwinet as
    living when the settlers arrived, but alludes to him as “the old
    Sachem.”</p>

  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> <b>Vide Macy’s History of Nantucket</b>.</div>

  <p>Among the Indian tribes there were generally one or two Sachems
    who controlled all the others. These were known as Chief or Head
    Sachems, and they exercised absolute control. Such in Nantucket were
    Wanackmamack and Wauwinet or his son and successor, Nicornoose.</p>

  <p>According to Zaccheus Macy, Wanackmamack’s territory represented the
    southeast of the island and was bounded by a line running from Toupchue
    pond in the south, northward, roughly to Gibbs’ pond, and so over
    toward Podpis swamp, and then eastward to Sesacacha pond.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> These, and the boundaries of the other Sachems’ property
    are clearly delineated on Dr. Ewer’s map of Nantucket.</div>

  <p><b>Wanackmamack</b> had one son, Saucoauso or Jeptha, who married
    Eastor.</p>

  <p>Saucoauso had two sons, Cain and Abel.</p>

  <p>Cain had one daughter, Jemima, who married James Shay, Shea or Shaa.</p>

  <p>Abel had two sons, Ben Abel and Eben Abel.</p>

  <p>Wanackmamack died before June 9th, 1682, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> his son, Saucoauso,
    on this date, “having understood that his father Wanackmamack <b>now
    deceased</b>, had granted (to) English pasturage on east end of island,
    also sells same.”</p>

  <p>Wauwinet’s boundary-line adjoined that of Wanackmamack on the north,
    extending due north to Coatue and Nauma, westward to Wesco (now
    Nantucket), and hence, almost due south to Weeweder pond.</p>

  <p><b>Wauwinet</b> had two sons, Isaac or Nicornoose, (also known as
    Nickanoose) and Waupordongga, and one daughter, Wonoma, who married
    Autopscot.</p>

  <p>Nicornoose had two sons, Joshua and Isaac Wauwinet, and one daughter,
    Askommopoo, by his wife. Askommopoo married Spoospotswa, known as
    “Spotso.”</p>

  <p>Nicornoose forsook his wife and, by another woman, had two sons, Wat
    and Paul Noose.</p>

  <p>Joshua Nicornoose was so disgusted by his father’s leaving his mother
    that he left home altogether, and did not return until after an absence
    of over 50 years, when he claimed his inheritance and after some delay,
    it was restored to him.</p>

  <p>Autopscot’s jurisdiction extended over the southwest of the island
    from Weeweder pond northerly to Monomoy, and then westward to the
    Popsquatchet hills and to Hummock pond.</p>

  <p><b>Autopscot</b> had a son, Harry Poritain, or Beretan, by Wonoma, his
    wife, who was the daughter of Wauwinet.</p>

  <p>Harry Poritain had a son named Isaac Masauquet.</p>

  <p>Masauquet had a son named Peter.</p>

  <p>Peter had a son known as Lame Isaac, who ceded the last rights of his
    sachemdom.</p>

  <p>Autopscot had also grandchildren named Tashama, of whom more anon.</p>

  <p>Potconet’s (or Pottacohannet’s) dominions are uncertain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> and there
    is some doubt as to their limitations. It is at least certain that
    he was Sachem of the adjacent island of Tuckernuck, but Zaccheus
    Macy, in his well known letter, states that his bounds extended from
    Madaket down eastward to Wesko and Capaum pond, thus lying north of
    Autopscot’s possessions, and that they also included the western coast.
    Moreover, Dr. Ewer’s map,—probably based upon the information supplied
    by Macy—delineates the northwestern section of the island as having
    belonged to Potconet; but no proof is in evidence, and although it
    seems reasonable to suppose that some sachem must have represented this
    section of the island, no deed has been found to cover it. Macy also
    asserts that Potconet sold all his rights to the English settlers, save
    those reserved and secured to some of the old natives, known as the
    Hoights and Jafets—in the neighborhood of Wannacomet or Capaum pond.</p>

  <p>Be this as it may, from a foot-note to Hough’s <b>Nantucket Papers</b>,
    it appears that, on February 20th, 1661, Wanackmamack, Head-Chief of
    Nantucket, sold to Tristram Coffin, Sr., Peter Coffin, Tristram Coffin,
    Jr., and James Coffin, for £10, half of the island of Tuckernuck—one
    half down, and the other, when Thomas Mayhew decides <b>who is the
    proper owner</b>.</p>

  <p><b>Potconet, or Pottacohannet</b> had two sons, Akeamong, or Ahkeiman,
    and Jacob.</p>

  <p>Why did neither of these sons claim his rights until 1672—a period of
    11 years? Was Potconet living in 1661? These questions have still to be
    answered, although I have unsuccessfully sought in every direction for
    a satisfactory reply.</p>

  <p>In the Registry of Nantucket Deeds, under date June 20, 1672, is the
    following entry: “Ahkeiman laying claim to part of Tuckanuck his
    claim thereto is found no other but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> as he was a <b>duke or principal
    man upon Nantucket</b>; the Nantucket Sachems, <b>together with his
    father</b>, having sold <b>Tuckanuck</b>, it is ordered that he shall
    have such a part or portion of land for his use at Nantucket of the
    present Sachems as will become one of such quality, and a portion of
    the whales.”</p>

  <p>On page 211 of the Book of Town Records, dated March, 1681, there is a
    record of a bargain between James Coffin, Peter Coffin, John Coffin,
    and Stephen Coffin, and Ackeamong and Jacob, sons of Pottacohannet
    (Potconet), concerning Tuckanuckett, said Ackeamong and Jacob claiming
    half of it. The said Coffins having delivered them 40 acres arable
    land on Nantucket and £5, and disclaiming any right to any whale, the
    said Ackeamong and Jacob renounce any claim to any part of Tuckernuck,
    reserving liberty to save their whale that may come ashore.</p>

  <p>To this is affixed the marks of Ackeamong and Jacob, James Coffin and
    Stephen Coffin, 6th of March, 1681.</p>

  <p>Witnessed by William Worth and Richard Pincom (Pinkham), and
    acknowledged on the same date before William Worth, magistrate.</p>

  <p>It does not appear, however, why the order of the Court made in 1672,
    was not carried out until 1681—a period of nine years.</p>

  <p>Potconet must therefore, have died before March 6th, 1681, or his sons
    could not have made the above agreement; if, indeed, he was not dead
    before 1672, when Akeamong made his first claim.</p>

  <p>Some confusion has arisen as to the standing of Nanahuma, who signed
    the first Indian deed with Nickanoose. Mr. H. Barnard Worth<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> says:
    ... “They (the English) obtained a deed, dated June 20th, 1659, from
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>Sachems Nickanoose and Nanahuma, of a tract comprising the section
    of Nantucket west of Hummock Pond.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> George Nanahuma was the sachem
    of the Indians that lived in this section but <b>Nickanoose held some
    sway over him</b>, and joined in the conveyance.” With this I am in
    perfect accord, with the exception of Mr. Worth’s using the definite
    instead of the indefinite article, as indicated in boldface in the
    above quotation. I believe that it should read thus: “Comprising a
    section of Nantucket west of Hummock Pond”; and further, “George
    Nanahuma was a sachem of the Indians, etc.” The force of this will be
    seen presently.</p>

  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> The western half of Nantucket was sold by Wanackmamack,
    February 20th, 1661.</div>

  <p>There is no deed to prove who was the legitimate sachem, if any
    existed, of the Western section of Nantucket, but a section west of
    Hummock pond apparently belonged to Nanahuma, viz: the neck which bears
    his name, part of the woods to the north of it, and he possibly may
    have had a proprietary interest in the <b>large plain</b> further west.
    I think this view is borne out in the “first Indian Deed.”</p>

  <p>In this deed “the plain” is evidently immediately west of Nanahuma’s
    Neck from the use of the word Acamy in the deed (“on the other side of
    the water”), and its locality is further fixed by the description of
    its position, which agrees almost mathematically with its exact actual
    position.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I am sorry to differ from Mr. Worth when he says: “the
    deed of Nanahuma indicates that at the time he was sachem over the west
    end of Nantucket.” It might as truly be said that the co-signer was
    sachem over the west end of Nantucket, which we know he never was.</p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> <b>Vide</b> Ewer’s Map.</div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

  <p>I believe that Nanahuma was a subsidiary or petty local sachem,
    tributary to Nickanoose, and that all the property he owned as a sachem
    was restricted within the limitations already indicated. This is
    confirmed by his only subsequent deed, dated June 24th, 1678, by which
    he disposes of “all his interest in the West plains, and to the Neck or
    long woods” to the English. Besides, according to the delimitation of
    the other Sachems as already given, none of them interfered with those
    just mentioned as belonging to Nanahuma.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it is doubtful whether Nanahuma at this time owned the Neck
    which bore his name, for, on July 4th, 1664, “all the fields belonging
    to the Neck” were sold to the English by Pakapanessa, Jonas Kimmo and
    Harry, son of Wapakowet, who were probably residents of the identical
    “plain” which was sold by Nanahuma in 1659. Moreover, in 1667, we find
    Nanahuma associated with “Mr. Larry Ahkeramo” and Obadiah in a plea to
    the Court that “whereas the sachems had sold the ground they formerly
    lived on to the English, the said sachems would not entertain them on
    the land unsold.” Curiously enough, in 1678, we find George Nanahuma,
    alias Cowpohanet, selling to the English “all his interest in the West
    plains, and to the Neck or long woods.” There, verily, seems to have
    been a joint stock company in these lands!</p>

  <p>If Potconet had no jurisdiction over the northwest section of
    Nantucket, and if no evidence is in existence as to any other sachem
    holding predominant rights over it, may it not be suggested that
    it was mainly divided up into reallotments for the Indians who
    were dispossessed by the requirements of the whites, and over whom
    subsidiary sachems or sagamores were appointed, of whom there were
    several? Of course, this is a mere suggestion.</p>

  <p>We talk glibly and deprecatingly of the poor Indians as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> “mere
    savages”, but the annals of American history afford but few instances
    of really nobler men than Massassoit, Passaconaway, Samoset, and
    Wanackmamack, the controlling Head Sachem of Nantucket. Had it not been
    for the high personal qualities of such men New England might not have
    occupied today the proud position which she now holds among the United
    States.</p>

  <p>The venerable Chief Wanackmamack was not only the pride and glory
    of his insular braves, but the tried, true, and loyal friend of the
    English immigrants. He was as kind-hearted and judicious as he was
    courageous and high principled, and he governed his home-land so ably
    and satisfactorily as to justify his memory in history as an exemplary
    ruler.</p>

  <p>Of Wauwinet little is known but that he was very old and much respected
    when the settlers arrived, and nothing, so far as I have been able to
    ascertain, has been said against him.</p>

  <p>Nicornoose, his eldest son and successor, has not a good record, as he
    deserted his wife and children, and had two children by another woman.</p>

  <p>Beyond the fact that Autopscot was called “a great warrior and got his
    land by his bow”, and that he permanently established peace throughout
    the island, little further is recorded of him. Nor does history mention
    anything concerning Potconet, the sachem ruling the proximate western
    islands, with the exception of a record of the sale of his lands to the
    settlers, in 1659. Such were the rulers of Nantucket when the settlers
    arrived.</p>

  <p>What a revelation the incoming of the whites must have been to the red
    men, who had lived on the island, probably from a very early age, among
    their own people, under their own laws, perpetuating their own habits
    and customs—living close to Nature—for the most part in peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> and
    amity—simple in their lives, and knowing nothing, caring nothing for
    the external world beyond them!</p>

  <p>Yet, on the arrival of the new people who had come to supplant them,
    they received them amicably, treated them justly, and as they treated
    one another, relying upon what they recognized as the instinctive and
    inalienable principles of humanity to govern their relationships and to
    promote the mutual good and harmony of all. I cannot stop to inquire
    who first took advantage of the racial differences which distinguished
    these two peoples, or how the greater intellectuality and experience of
    the one eventually overcame the other, but Time tells the story; and
    today, while the whites glory in the beauties of, and the opportunities
    afforded by their island home, where are the poor Indians, the
    aborigines? All gone—melted away like dew-drops in the sun, and not
    even one remains to tell the story of their past history!</p>

  <p>The number of settlers who had arrived from Salisbury in 1660 and 1661
    soon began to make themselves comfortable in their new and strange
    environment, while the Indians could not but admire the novel type of
    dwelling houses which the new-comers had set up in strange contrast
    with the humble wigwams of the aborigines; indeed the new procedure
    which was being introduced in many directions must have caused them
    much surprise.</p>

  <p>For a time the English and the Indians—the civilized and the
    uncivilized—worked together amicably for the agricultural development
    of the island. Together they cleared and tilled the land (for the most
    part existing as a primeval wilderness), settling the allotments,
    cutting down the timber, which is said to have almost covered the
    island, and mutually performing the numerous farming operations
    involved in the reclamation and cultivation of the soil. In addition to
    farming they engaged also in fishing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> in which art the natives were
    expert. Much time was also devoted to the raising of sheep, and thus
    while mutual forbearance was exercised, mutual trust was generated, and
    while the settlers acted faithfully and justly with the Indians, the
    latter were equally loyal in the discharge of their duties in their new
    relationships.</p>

  <p>When King Philip visited the island in 1665 and tried to induce
    the natives to join in his contemplated war with the English, they
    emphatically refused to do so, expressing themselves as perfectly
    satisfied and desiring to be at peace with the whites. Indeed, at a
    town meeting, on October 10th, 1665, Attaychat (Autopscot) “signified
    that himself with all the Tomokommoth Indians subject to the English
    Government in Nantucket, acknowledge subjection to King Charles II.
    This was done in the presence of Metacomet, alias Philip, Sachem of
    Mount Hop.”</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, civilization has too often brought in its wake habits
    and customs which have ever proved degenerative, if not destructive to
    the uncivilized races of the earth, and so they proved to the Indians,
    who were sober, industrious, and happy before the settlers introduced
    among them the iniquitous “fire-water,” to the abuse of which they
    fell a prey. Acting under its pernicious influence their primitive
    instincts were aroused within them, and never afterwards were they the
    same people. Discontent soon spread among them, and litigation in the
    Courts—to which they had equal access with the whites—became so very
    frequent that the records extend from 1673 to 1754.</p>

  <p>I do not say that alcohol was at the bottom of all these cases, but
    that it made the natives excitable, litigious and dissatisfied I avow,
    without any reference to the misconduct and crime which it often
    prompted, and which frequently resulted from its influence. In many
    cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> they found that the Courts decided against them, and they became
    discouraged. Moreover, they were astounded at the fastly-increasing
    number of whites on the island (so that offensive measures were out
    of the question), and as a matter of fact they never could be made to
    understand that the execution of a sale-deed of their property involved
    its absolute surrender to the purchaser, however many attempts they
    made to regain their land.</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Macy wrote a forceful letter to the Governor, in May, 1676,
    as to the pernicious effects of drink upon the natives, but every
    effort made to mitigate the evil by legislative measures failed; the
    natives who craved for it would sacrifice all they possessed, and one
    way and another, they generally found means of obtaining it. Fines and
    whipping were the modes inflicted for drunkenness and misdemeanors,
    but the death-penalty was never exacted except in cases of deliberate
    murder. It is recorded that, between 1704 and 1769, ten natives were
    executed for capital crimes.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p>On the other hand it has been stated that Quibby—who murdered Harry
    Gardner—was the first and only Indian executed in Nantucket since
    its settlement by the whites. Macy’s instances, however, seem well
    substantiated.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> “Miriam Coffin.”</div>

  <p>In thus alluding to the misconduct of the natives I am merely
    mentioning facts which I should have preferred to pass over, but in
    justice to their memory it must be said that perhaps the majority of
    them were exemplary in their lives—many of them pious—and good steady
    husbandmen and craftsmen. As a race they have been much misrepresented,
    and if revengeful, it was only when their subduers had treated them
    cruelly or unjustly.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

  <p>Spirited efforts had been made to introduce Christianity among the
    natives, and the results on Nantucket were probably more successful
    than in any other section of New England. Thus, Barber (in his
    <b>Historical Collections</b>, page 448) says: “Soon after the English
    had settled on the island, attempts were made to convert the Indians to
    the faith of the Gospel, and, in course of years, all of them became
    nominal Christians.”</p>

  <p>Soon after 1680, all the old Sachems, who were alive when the English
    arrived had passed away, and their successors reigned in their stead.</p>

  <p>As Macy says: “The Indians were instructed in the mode of fishing
    practised by the whites, and, in return, the whites were assisted by
    the Indians in pursuing the business.” Another writer says: “There
    is no doubt that the Natick Indians hunted the whale in canoes, in a
    manner somewhat similar to that practised today by the Bow-Meaders
    of the north coast of Siberia.” Moreover, I have been personally
    informed by a gentleman of much culture and experience who knows as
    much about the Nantucket Whaling industry as any man now alive, that
    “hunting the whale was well-known and long practised by the Nantucket
    Indians.” If any further evidence is deemed necessary it may be found
    in the following quotation from <b>Weymouth’s Voyage</b>: “One especial
    thing in their manner of killing a whale which they (the Indians) call
    <b>powdawe</b>, and will describe his form, how he bloweth up the
    water, and that he is twelve fathoms long, and that they go in company
    with their King, with a multitude of their boats, and strike him with
    a bone made in the fashion of a harping iron, fastened to a rope,
    which they make great and strong of the bark of trees which they veer
    out after him; that all their boats come about him, and as he riseth
    above water, with their arrows they shoot him to death.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> When they have
    killed him and dragged him to shore, they call all their chief lords
    together, and sing a song of joy, and these chief lords, whom they call
    sagamores, divide the spoil and give to every man a share; which pieces
    so distributed they hang up about their houses for provision, and when
    they boil them they blow off the fat, and put in their pease, maize and
    other pulse which they eat.”</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the Nantucket Indians joined gladly in the
    chase of whales, and that they were fully as dexterous as the whites,
    not only in securing, but in dealing with the carcasses afterwards.</p>

  <p>The year 1763–4 was, indeed, a sad one for the Indians of Nantucket,
    inasmuch as, from August in the former year to February in the latter,
    they suffered from a malignant form of epidemic which, even yet, has
    not been identified, although the probability is that it was either
    typhus or typhoid fever, small-pox or yellow fever. Curiously enough,
    of the English who visited them daily, caring for and nursing the
    afflicted natives, not one was affected by the pestilence, which ceased
    suddenly, without previous abatement, on the 16th of February, 1764.
    Before the epidemic broke out there were 358 Indians on the island, of
    whom 222 perished, leaving only 136 natives to represent the race.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> Obed, Macy; <b>opus cit.</b></div>

  <p>In 1791 there were but four male Indians and sixteen females left on
    the island, and in 1809 there were only three or four persons of pure
    blood and a few of mixed race.</p>

  <p>From 1664 to 1774 the records consist mainly of land-sales from the
    Indians to the English; of complaints of one Indian against another,
    or others in relation to landsales,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> and of controversies about their
    respective claims to whales. Within this period also one repeatedly
    notices the names of the successors of the old sachems, for several
    generations; but, concurrently with these, up to 1754, are the records
    of many attempts on the part of some of the Indians to regain their
    lands.</p>

  <p>The perusal of these is very interesting, but I can only refer those
    who may desire to obtain a full knowledge of such matters to the ample
    and careful reports given by Mr. Henry B. Worth in the Bulletins of the
    Nantucket Historical Association.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>Petty crimes and misdemeanors on the part of the Indians—too often
    caused by “fire-water”—frequently resulted in producing considerable
    trouble and annoyance to the proprietors, and when they found that the
    imposition of fines and the infliction of whipping in graver cases
    were inadequate to permanently restrain them, they at length appointed
    a superior Indian to undertake the office of superintendent and local
    magistrate, and with considerable success. The officer appointed was
    James Shouel, better known as Korduda and he soon became a terror to
    evil-doers, his usual procedure being, when one Indian complained of
    another, to order both the complainant and the defendant to be well
    whipped. This subsequently became known as “Korduda’s law,” and in
    many, if not in most cases, it was found very effective. He was also in
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> habit of having delinquents whipped for neglecting the cultivation
    of their corn, for drunkenness, etc.</p>

  <p>A few other special Indians are referred to in Zaccheus Macy’s
    well-known letter, viz.: “Old Aesop,” the weaver, who was also a
    schoolmaster; “Old Saul,” “a stern-looking old man;” Richard Nominash
    and his brother Sampson and little Jethro, who are described as “very
    substantial and very trusty men;” Zacchary Hoite, a minister who told
    his hearers “they must do as he said, but not as he did!” There were
    also some members of the old Hoight and Jafet families, and Benjamin
    Tashama, an Indian of strong individuality, to whom I shall now refer
    in detail.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Tashama, or Tashima, was, perhaps, the most noted Indian
    within the bounds of Autopscot. He was a grandson of Sachem Autopscot,
    and was distinguished as a good and worthy man, an esteemed preacher,
    and a successful schoolmaster. “A portion of the industrious life of
    Tashima,” says the author of “Miriam Coffin,” “had been devoted to
    study; and he had succeeded, with infinite labour, in adapting his
    literary acquirements to the language and capacity of his tribe. He
    had nourished the vain hope of preserving the nation without a cross
    in its blood, and the language of his people in its pristine purity.
    It was a magnificent conception! The design was worthy of the last, as
    he was the greatest, chief of his tribe. He was the last, because none
    succeeded him; he was the greatest, for he was the most benevolent.”
    While few details of his life are known it is attested that he latterly
    lived on the eastern boundary of Gibbs’ swamp, about forty rods
    northeast of the fifth milestone on the ’Sconset road. Here, some years
    ago, the cellar of his dwelling still remained, and the large stone
    which formed the entrance may now be seen in the rooms of the Nantucket
    Historical Association.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

  <p>Here Tashama, often called “the last Sachem of Nantucket,” dwelt with
    his son Isaac and his daughter Sarah. Benjamin Tashama died in 1770.
    His brother, John Tashama, was alive in 1754, when he signed a petition
    to the court. John had one son, Abram, mentioned by John Coffin and
    Abishai Folger in a report dated May 25th, 1743.</p>

  <p>Sarah Tashama married Isaac Earop, and on April 27th, 1776, a daughter
    was born to them. She was named Dorcas Honorable. When this child grew
    up she became a domestic in the family of Mr. John Cartwright, where
    she lived for many years, and she died in 1822.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <hr class="fn">
  <div class="footnote mb3"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> For these facts I am indebted to a statement made by
    Mr. Franklin Folger in May, 1743. <b>Vide</b> “Inquirer and Mirror”,
    October 29, 1910.</div>

  <p><b>She was a full-blooded Indian, and the very last of her race on
    Nantucket</b>; and thus, little more than two centuries from the
    discovery of the island, passed away the only remaining one of the
    aboriginal people who had dominated it from time immemorial.</p>

  <p>Abram Api Quady or Quary, a half-breed, who lived in a hut at Shimmo
    for many years, died in 1855 at the age of 83, respected by all who
    knew him. He was the son of the notorious Quibby, already referred
    to, and of Judith Quary—a half-breed fortune-teller well-known on the
    island at one time. Abram, for obvious reasons, chose to assume his
    mother’s name. A fine portrait in oil of this dignified old man may be
    seen in the Nantucket Atheneum.</p>

  <p>It may seem strange that no burial place of the Indians has been
    discovered on the island of Nantucket, so far as I am aware. Skeletal
    remains and a few bones have been discovered at one time and another,
    and in various places, but I believe no regular place of Indian burial
    has ever been found. This may be thus accounted for, viz.:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p>Island Indians usually buried their dead contiguous to the coast-line,
    and the progressive erosion of the coast during two centuries may
    have possibly washed such remains into the ocean. This is merely a
    suggestion, and as I have but few proofs to offer, I am subject to
    correction. It is probable, however, that the Indians buried their
    dead in the neighborhood of Shawkemo, Pocomo, Folger’s Hill on the
    Polpis road, at Quaise, beyond the present water-works, and at or near
    Miacomet. It is recorded that there was a circular burying-ground for
    one of the tribes near the head-waters of Lake Miacomet, and that
    Benjamin Tashama was buried there.</p>

  <p>An opinion too generally shared, which regards the American Indian race
    as consisting of mere savages, almost inhuman in their ferocity and
    cruelty, and without a redeeming feature of any kind, is as untrue as
    it is unjust. They naturally possessed those characteristics shared by
    all unenlightened races of men who have been deprived of the elevating
    influences of civilization and a high code of ethics, but a careful
    study of their lives and history shows that, according to their
    enlightenment, they were actuated by many virtues which, in superior
    races, count for dignified manhood and nobility of mind. In personal
    bravery and courage they had few equals and yet they accepted conquest
    or punishment with a sublime fortitude and stoicism which scorned to
    ask for either life or pardon. Equality, freedom, and independence
    constituted the very atmosphere of their being and, in their dealings
    with their own race, the rights of each individual, and his personal
    freedom, were universally acknowledged. Judged from our modern standard
    the principles of morality which governed their lives, if of a lower
    order, were yet in keeping with their instincts and their environment,
    and they believed that “the crimes of the vicious were punished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> the
    disgrace, contempt and danger they ensured for transgressors.”</p>

  <p>When all that can be said against the Indians has been spoken it must
    be conceded that they embodied a pure and lofty patriotism, for which
    they fought and died like men and true patriots, and although they had
    to gradually yield up their possessions and their homes in the land
    they loved, and to recede and disappear before the advancing wave of
    civilization, yet, as De Forest says: “We may drop a tear over the
    grave of the race which has perished, and regret that civilization and
    Christianity have ever accomplished so little for its amelioration.”</p>

  <p>In the somewhat severe words of Obed Macy, “Their only misfortune was
    their connection with Christians, and their only crime the imitation of
    their manners.”</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I venture to make two suggestions, one a minor and the
    other a major one. Would it not be expedient and appropriate on the
    part of the Nantucketers to erect a tablet over the grave of “Dorcas,”
    the last of the aborigines? The residents of “the little purple
    island,” I think, owe so much to the memories associated with her
    vanished race.</p>

  <p>Or, now that Nantucket is becoming, increasingly, year by year, a
    fashionable ocean-bound sea-resort, would it not be possible to carry
    out the suggestion made by an off-islander, as far back as 1881 at the
    Commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the death of Tristram Coffin,
    to erect by public subscription “a towering statue in dusky bronze,
    representing the venerable Indian Sachem, Wanackmamack, the tried and
    true friend of the original purchasers of the island?” The island
    certainly owes this illustrious Chief a debt of gratitude, for it was
    almost entirely due to his benign influences that the “silent people
    of the forest” and the strangers lived in peace and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> amity together,
    and thus expedited the dawn of civilization without an obstacle within
    its boundaries. I have spoken, and I leave these suggestions to the
    islanders for reflection, with every fond wish for their prosperity and
    success.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
